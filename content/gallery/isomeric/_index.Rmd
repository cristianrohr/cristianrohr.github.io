[Isomeric doppelgangers](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/isomeric-doppelgangers)

Spatial isomerism, is a form of isomerism in which molecules have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space.

This artworks flips several boxes on the X or Y axis, resulting in two gemelar images, each with the same palette but a different color mix. The perception of diverse scenes is based only on these modifications.

The collection is limited to 100 works of art.
