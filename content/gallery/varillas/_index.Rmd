[Varillas](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/16015)

'Varillas' is a series of 250 generative artworks.

My goal was to generate the sensation of organized randomness.

Several followers noted the similarity of many artworks generated by this system to Mikado. In Argentina Mikado is known as 'chinese sticks'. 'Varillas' are long thin rods of wood or metal, in this case generative.

Artwork by @cristianrohr (2022).

Made with P5js and <3.
