[CR Art Sessions //2](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22260)

Grayscale, Hold the Line, and Mondrian walk into a bar. The bartender looks up and says, "What is this, some kind of art project?"

Grayscale responds, "No, we're just here for a drink."

Hold the Line adds, "But we can definitely add some color to the place if you want."

Mondrian chimes in, "I prefer to keep things simple and stick to the basics."

The bartender shakes his head and says, "I'll be the judge of that. What can I get you all?"

Grayscale orders a Guinness, Hold the Line asks for a gin and tonic, and Mondrian asks for a glass of white wine.

The bartender serves up the drinks and says, "That will be $15.50, please."

Grayscale pulls out a twenty-dollar bill and hands it to the bartender, saying, "Keep the change."

The bartender thanks him and says, "Thanks, Grayscale. You always know how to liven up the place."

Hold the Line raises his glass and says, "Cheers to that!"

Mondrian nods and clinks glasses with the others, and the three of them enjoy their drinks and the rest of their evening at the bar.
