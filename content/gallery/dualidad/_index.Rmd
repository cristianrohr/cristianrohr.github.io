[Dualidad](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/23695)

The concept of 'Dualidad' (duality) is brought to life through the use of opposing elements, circles, and rectangles, in the artwork.

The circles, like the stillness of a calm pond, remain in close places while they continuously transform. In contrast, the rectangles are a representation of movement and change, constantly traveling across the canvas.

This balance of opposing elements creates a dynamic tension that draws the viewer in, leaving them mesmerized by the ever-evolving artwork. Expect to see a range of emotions, from the euphoria of joy to the depth of sorrow, as you explore the duality of this project.
